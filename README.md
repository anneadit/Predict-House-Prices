# Predict-House-Prices
In this project we will analyze housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa and try to predict the sale price of houses based on some features. We will first clean the data, transform some of the features, and then select the relevant features for Linear Regression.

Information about the dataset can be found @ http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt

The aim of this project is to emphasize the importance and amount of time spent of Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering. 

The raw data  can be found in .tsv file
